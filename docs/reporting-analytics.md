Through data cubes, users can examine the same batch of data from different angles to gain comprehensive insights.

The system will support slice and dice operations to help users focus on data subsets of interest. Slice operations select specific values of a dimension to filter qualifying data subsets; dice operations select specific value combinations of multiple dimensions to filter more refined data subsets. These operations will help users deeply analyze complex data relationships layer by layer.

Drill-down function will support users moving between dimension levels. For example, drilling from annual sales data to quarterly data, then to monthly data; or drilling from national data to regional data, then to provincial data. This drill-down capability will help users deeply explore layer by layer to find problem root causes.

### Trend Analysis and Forecasting

Trend analysis helps users understand historical patterns of indicators. The system will provide multiple trend analysis methods. Moving average analysis will calculate moving averages of indicators to smooth short-term fluctuations and display long-term trends; exponential smoothing analysis will give greater weight to recent data to capture latest trend changes; seasonal decomposition will separate trends, seasonal factors, and random factors to more accurately understand data changes.

Predictive analysis will forecast future business indicators based on historical data. The system will provide multiple prediction models such as linear regression, exponential smoothing, and ARIMA, where users can select appropriate models based on data characteristics. Prediction results will include predicted values and confidence intervals to help users understand prediction reliability.

The system will also provide prediction accuracy monitoring functions by comparing actual values with previous predictions to calculate prediction errors. Users can thereby evaluate prediction model effectiveness and adjust prediction methods when necessary.

Users can share report links with other users where shared users can directly access report content. Sharing can set access permissions such as read-only, commenting, or editable to meet different collaboration scenario needs.

Commenting function will allow users to add comments on reports to discuss analysis findings with team members. Comments will be anchored to specific report locations where other users can reply and discuss. This collaborative analysis will promote team knowledge sharing and collective wisdom.

Version management function will record report historical versions where users can view report change history and compare differences between different versions. When necessary, users can roll back to previous versions to ensure continuity of analysis work. Version management is particularly important for reports requiring multi-person collaborative editing to avoid version conflicts and data loss.

### Report Subscription and Distribution

The system will support report subscription functions where users can subscribe to concerning reports to automatically receive notifications when reports are updated. Subscription settings can choose notification methods (email, push, in-app message) and frequency (real-time, daily summary, weekly summary). This automated mechanism will help users timely obtain key data without manual checking.

Timed distribution function will support setting timed report generation and sending. Users can configure to generate last week's sales report and send to sales team every Monday morning, or generate last month's financial report and send to management at the beginning of each month. Timed tasks will execute in the background to ensure reports are generated and delivered on time.

Distribution list management will support maintaining multiple distribution groups where each group contains a set of recipients. Users can create sales groups to distribute to sales teams, financial groups to distribute to finance departments to achieve targeted information pushing. Distribution groups can include external personnel such as external consultants and partners to meet external reporting needs.
