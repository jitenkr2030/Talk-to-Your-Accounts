After dedicating the past 5 months to developing this app, I've decided to open source it for the greater good.

My goal is to make it **the most efficient and privacy-focused voice-to-text solution for macOS** that is a joy to use. While the source code is now open for experienced developers to build and contribute, purchasing a license helps support continued development and gives you access to automatic updates, priority support, and upcoming features.

Features
--------

* 🎙️ **Accurate Transcription**: Local AI models that transcribe your voice to text with 99% accuracy, almost instantly
* 🔒 **Privacy First**: 100% offline processing ensures your data never leaves your device
* ⚡ **Power Mode**: Intelligent app detection automatically applies your perfect pre-configured settings based on the app/ URL you're on
* 🧠 **Context Aware**: Smart AI that understands your screen content and adapts to the context
* 🎯 **Global Shortcuts**: Configurable keyboard shortcuts for quick recording and push-to-talk functionality
* 📝 **Personal Dictionary**: Train the AI to understand your unique terminology with custom words, industry terms, and smart text replacements
* 🔄 **Smart Modes**: Instantly switch between AI-powered modes optimized for different writing styles and contexts
* 🤖 **AI Assistant**: Built-in voice assistant mode for a quick chatGPT like conversational assistant
